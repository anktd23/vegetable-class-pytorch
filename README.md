# Vegetable Image Classification Using Pytorch

## Classify images of several types of vegetables using CNNs, Resnets and other deep learning techniques.

## Dataset 
There are 21000 images from 15 classes, where each class contains a total of 1400 images. Each class has an equal proportion and image resolution is 224Ã—224 and in *.jpg format. We split our dataset into three parts, where 70%(approx.) for training and 15%(approx.) for testing, and the rest 15%(approx.) for validation.
